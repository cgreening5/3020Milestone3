# 3020Milestone3
Comp 3020 group project. Design for an automated ordering system for a restaurant.

The purpose of this project was more the the process of various types of prototyping and requirements gathering; this project itself is intended as a high fidelity prototype. Thus, the emphasis was on the design and usability of the interface, rather than the quality of the code.
